                The intergalactic conqueror Thanos hailed from the planet Titan, destroyed by overpopulation and lack of resources. Wishing to save the universe by destroying half of its population, he began to collect powerful infinity stones, with which he would have the opportunity to transform the world. Thanos took over various planets and took children to be raised as assassins of the Black Order, including Gamora and Nebula. On Thanos' orders, Loki headed to Earth with the Chitauri army and tried to capture the Tesseract, but was defeated by the Avengers.
                    Later, Thanos sent Ronan the Accuser to get the Sphere, but he found out about the power stone inside it and chose to use it on his own, but lost to the Guardians of the Galaxy and missed the stone that Thanos took from the Nova Corps. With the destruction of Asgard, Thanos reaches the refugee ship and receives a Tesseract with the space stone from Loki, killing him and destroying the ship, and then captures the reality stone from the Collector in Oblivion, where he meets Gamora and kidnaps her, hoping to find out the location of the soul stone.
                    After forcing Gamora to watch Nebula's torture, Thanos goes with her to Vormir to get the stone and is forced to sacrifice her to get the stone. From there, he travels to Titan, fights with part of the Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy for the Time Stone and receives it from Doctor Strange in exchange for Iron Man's life. Finally, Thanos arrives on Earth and, easily defeating the heroes, rips the mind stone out of Vision's head. Despite being hit in the chest with Thor's axe, Thanos manages to snap his fingers, killing half the universe, and disappear to a peaceful planet, enjoying the sunset. Having fulfilled the idea, Thanos stayed on the planet and started a farm. To eliminate the possibility of undoing the extermination, Titan used the power of the stones to destroy them, and their use attracted the attention of the surviving Avengers. The team arrived on the planet and demanded the stones, and upon learning the truth, Thor stripped Thanos of his head.Five years later, the Avengers developed a plan to steal stones from the past and successfully took the stones from different time points. During one of the missions, Nebula from 2023 had a glitch, and her memory merged with that of Nebula 2014, revealing the plan to Thanos from the past. Thanos captured the Nebula of the present, and the Nebula of the past took her place, which allowed her to let the Titan army into 2023, where the Avengers assembled a copy of the Infinity Gauntlet and brought the dead back to life. Thanos defeated the Avengers base and met the heroes in the ruins. The mad Titan defeated Thor, Captain America and Iron Man one by one, and with the arrival of all the defenders of the universe, a battle broke out in which Thanos managed to snatch the Glove from Captain Marvel's hands. Putting on a Glove, the titan snapped his fingers, but there was no effect - at the last moment the stones turned into the armor of Iron Man, who sprayed the attacking army and worthily accepted Thanos' death.
