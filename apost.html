                As his perfect embodiment, Ultron created an android from vibranium and synthetic human tissues, placing a mind stone in his head - one of the infinity stones, powerful cosmic artifacts. During the transportation of the body being created, the Avengers intercepted it and loaded Jarvis there, completing the work. The awakened android called himself Vision and joined the team in order to establish peace. In the final battle, Vision removed Ultron from the world Wide web, which allowed the heroes to defeat his army. Vision personally destroyed the last Ultron and later joined a new team. Later, Vision agreed to accept the superpower registration agreement and sided with Iron Man, remaining one of the few officially active heroes.

For two years after the split of the Avengers, Vision hid with the Scarlet Witch in Scotland under the guise of an ordinary man, until Proxima Midnight and Corvus Glave attacked him to take his infinity stone. Saved by Captain America Vision came out of the battle wounded and offered to destroy the stone, for which the heroes go to Wakanda for Shuri's help. While the Avengers and the Wakandans were fighting against the horsemen of Thanos, Vision had to abort the operation and kill Glave. Because of this, Vision asked the Witch to destroy the stone so that it would not go to Thanos, but the mad titan restored it with a time stone and killed Vision, tearing the stone from his head. During the period after the Click, Vision's body was restored by the M.E.C. organization with no memory of the past and used against the Scarlet Witch who captured the residents of Westview. After a short fight, the magical projection of the former Vision returned the memory to the physical body, and the revived android flew away.
